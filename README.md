# MMM-Chores

**MMM-Chores** is a module for [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror) that allows you to manage your household chores.

It provides an admin interface where you can add, edit, and delete tasks. You can also set due dates and assign tasks to different persons. The module displays the tasks on your MagicMirror, allowing you to keep track of your household chores at a glance.

The data is stored in `data.json` to make the data persistent between restarts.

*Update 2025-05-30: Added AI Generate, It is a helper that will create tasks for coming 7 days based on your data.json history. the more history accumulated the better it will get predicting tasks to create and whom to assign them to.
*Update 2025-06-13: AI generation now reads all open and completed tasks from data.json to avoid duplicates and learn recurrence patterns. It requires at least 30 completed tasks for accurate scheduling.
